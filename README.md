# X and O

Just a mini mini terminal game I built just coz I was bored and wanted to push something to github to reignite my streak.

## Features
1. 2-player multiplayer mode
2. Play against computer mode (basic AI)
3. Clean game board display per entry and game
4. Clean scoreboard detection and display
5. Win and tie detection

### Logs
- ~~Tomorrow I'd add another mode to play against computer~~
- ~~Tomorrow would add probably a score board, restart fix, and a way to enter a name for each players in multiplayers.~~
- Add machine learning to play against computer with Smarter AI (Minimax Algorithm - still learning)
- Add Tie predictor

### What I implemented today
- Improved 2-player multiplayer mode
- Prompted players for names and passed them into the respectively needed player outputs (Mapped the player names to their symbols)
- Implemented a persistent scoreboard

- Imporved input validation for positions that were out of range

## Concepts Used
- Defensive programming
- Data mapping
- Modular code design
- Game design thinking



Enjoy the game!
