# X and O

Just a mini mini terminal game I built just coz I was bored and wanted to push something to github to reignite my streak.

Logs
- ~~Tomorrow I'd add another mode to play against computer~~
- Tomorrow would add probably a score board, restart fix, and a way to enter a name for each players in multiplayers.
- Add machine learning to play against
- Add Tie predictor


Enjoy the game! Thanks.
